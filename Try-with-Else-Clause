In python, you can also use the else clause on the try-except block which must be present after all the except clauses. The code enters the else block only if the try clause does not raise an exception.

Example: Try with else clause
# Program to depict else clause with try-except
# Python 3
# Function which returns a/b
def AbyB(a , b):
	try:
		c = ((a+b) / (a-b))
	except ZeroDivisionError:
		print ("a/b result in 0")
	else:
		print (c)

# Driver program to test above function
AbyB(2.0, 3.0)
AbyB(3.0, 3.0)
